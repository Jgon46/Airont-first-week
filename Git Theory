What is GIT?
Git is a version control system and content control. It was created by Linus Torvals 
Was concibed like a distributed system where there is not a unique place to store all the info, like SVC, with Git, every copy became a repository and all 
of them save the history about every modification. 

Regular commands:

git add --> used to add files inside a git repository, could b e one by one, batch or wildcard.
git commit --> confirm all changes after a git add operation. The best practice request a comment to identify all changes and why.
